## Java Server Pages Level Ups â˜•

The content hours for java server pages services.

JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a Java standard technology that enables you to write dynamic, data-driven pages for your Java web applications. JSP is built on top of the Java Servlet specification. The two technologies typically work together, especially in older Java web applications. From a coding perspective, the most obvious difference between them is that with servlets you write Java code and then embed client-side markup (like HTML) into that code, whereas with JSP you start with the client-side script or markup, then embed JSP tags to connect your page to the Java backend.
